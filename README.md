# 🎯 Hybrid ANN + PCA + MLP Model for Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📝 Description
This project implements a sophisticated credit card fraud detection system using a hybrid approach combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The system is designed to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while maintaining high performance through dimensionality reduction and advanced neural network architectures.

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 PCA for efficient feature compression and dimensionality reduction
- 🧠 ANN with multiple dense layers for complex pattern recognition
- ⚖️ SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for handling imbalanced datasets
- 📊 Comprehensive evaluation metrics including ROC-AUC and Confusion Matrix
- 🚀 Real-time transaction analysis capabilities
- 📈 High accuracy and low false positive rates
