# Hybrid ANN + PCA + MLP Model for Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Description
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using a hybrid neural network model with PCA for dimensionality reduction.

## Features
- PCA for feature compression
- ANN with multiple dense layers
- SMOTE to handle imbalanced dataset
- ROC-AUC and Confusion Matrix for evaluation

## Run the Project
